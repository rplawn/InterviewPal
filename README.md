# InterviewPal Final Project

## Project Description 

InterviewPal is a React-native mobile app developed for our final project at Lighthouse Labs. It is designed to be an interview companion that helps prepare users for job readiness by mocking real-world interview scenarios. The front end of this project is built with React-native and makes requests to an API to fetch and store interview data from a database. 

## Project Features

- User can log in.
- User can choose between four popular industries to begin mock interview.
- User is presented with a variety of questions pertaining to their industry.
- User can submit and record answers for review later
- User answers are timed for self review (with no maximum)
- Upon completion, user is presented with summary screen to preview questions and submitted answers with opportunity to restart the app
